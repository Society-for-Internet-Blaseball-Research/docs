title: Team Statsheet
type: object
description: |-
  Represents the statsheet for a single team during a single game.

  The list of player statsheets are in order of player appearance in the game. If this is the home team, the first item will be the pitcher (as the pitcher is the first relevant player when the away team is batting).

  There are a few known issues with Team Statsheets:
   - Players that change their name mid-game (scattered, etc) will have 2 statsheets.
   - Both pitchers will appear for each team, the correct one should have valid `outsRecorded` or `walksIssued` values.
   - The number of pitches thrown is attributed to the wrong pitcher.
   - Any player that makes a play will be included, including Ghosts.
