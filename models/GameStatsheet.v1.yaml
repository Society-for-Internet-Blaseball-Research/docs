title: Game Statsheet
type: object
description: |-
  Represents the statsheet of a single game. This object doesn't include much information by itself, but refers to the team statsheets (which in turn refer to the player statsheets) containing most of the useful statistics.

  In case of *Black Hole* or *Sun 2* weather, the runs by inning arrays may contain "negative runs" - 10 runs get subtracted from the runs for that inning, and adding up all the innings will still total the team's final score for that game.
