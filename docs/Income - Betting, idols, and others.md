## Betting

Betting is by far the most consistent way to earn income in blaseball and allows for you to most widely distribute potential risk by investing in a spread of teams.

Each day (except for the first day of a season or the post-season), one is able to bet for the subsequent days games, seeing the game matchup, the Blaseball.com stated odds for the game, the pitcher's pitching that game, and the weather for that day. One is then able to bet anywhere from 0 coins to 10 coins (initially), to 0 coins to 1000 coins (at maximum bet attainable). The betting limit is expanded by continually investing in the High Roller Snake Oil item in the Shop.
